# Hello React, Express, Babel, and Angular!

## What's this?
This is just a demo to proof hiro's reactJS and its related skills for a
certain startup company.

## The backend note
* This doesn't use express.Router, because this is a super-small demo.
* React stuff is compiled thru babel on server-side

## Requirements
* [Linux] or [OS X]
  (I use [ArchLinux], but it is for super-nerds. I recommend to use Ubuntu.)
* [NodeJS] with [NPM] (I use NodeJS 6.2.0)
* [Git]

[NodeJS]:https://nodejs.org
[NPM]: https://github.com/npm/npm
[GIT]: https://git-scm.com/
[ArchLinux]: https://www.archlinux.org/
[Linux]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux
[OS X]: http://www.apple.com/osx/

## How to setup
1. Open your favorite terminal
2. Clone the repo
3. cd into the repo.
4. Run `npm install`

That's it!

## How to run
1. Run `npm run server`
2. Open your favorite browser
3. Access `http://localhost:8888`

6. For each table column, Date indicates when the text was sent, and Text
